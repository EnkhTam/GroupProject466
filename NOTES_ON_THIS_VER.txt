Removed use of prepare statements, otherwise dates would submit as 0000-00-00 despite being submitted the same format as the db
Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page

Also haven't done anything abt unit conversion yet. Havent decided if will add table to db or just do math on-page

Still configured for phpmyadmin, so change the config file to use on mariadb or whatever you want
