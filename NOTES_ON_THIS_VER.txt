RECENT FIXES/CHANGES/UPDATES:
If registered user exists and all info the same, just log in
If change password matches old passwords, tells them it was previously used and updates
Added ability to reset password thru email (but that can't work on the school server) or for our situation, a form
Added security questions to use with password reset
Added display settings for nutrient and weight measurements utilizing unit conversion tables
Added a pong game bc why not

OTHER NOTES:
Could user reset password from userinfo page
Nothing's encrypted yet lol oops
Updated workout to include duration but hasn't been tested yet
Still need to put things in relevant views/public/etc. folders
Table measurement_conv requires viewing 2 pages to load all 72 rows, but this shouldn't be an issue since 
	use of site requires going through at least 2 pages
Add page titles, audios when updating styling
Could change workouts implementation to be like food:
	a table of workout types with [cals burned per time] instead of [nutrition info per serving] 
	and a separate table for workout logging

Cookies secretly like ever expire lol

Now configured for my mariadb but I'm gonna leave my phpmyadmin config in
See sqlheader.php and consql.php for current database and table usage/creation
SQL script is automatically run on site opening so that given someone's changed config.php for
	their own dbhost, the site should run on anything with minimal issue and no manual database
	scripting necessary
