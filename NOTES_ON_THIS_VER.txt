Cleaned up the code a ton and updated

Removed use of prepare statements, otherwise dates would submit as 0000-00-00 
	despite being submitted the same format as the db
Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page
Workouts table shows averages and totals for cals burned by doing math on-page
Tables added for unit conversion (consql.php)
Updated weight in userinfo so that it will delete weight logs for duplicate dates 
Added some styling
Updated food table to include unit of serving size

Still need to put things in relevant views/public/etc. folders
Table measurement_conv requires viewing 2 pages to load all 72 rows, but this shouldn't be an issue since 
	use of site requires going through at least 2 pages
Table headers still invisible
Add page titles, icons, cursors, audios when updating styling
Still haven't rlly implemented unit conversion bc idk what we're supposed to use it for
Might change workouts implementation to be like food; 
	a table of workout types with [cals burned per time] instead of [nutrition info per serving] 
	and a separate table for workout logging

Still configured for phpmyadmin, so change the config file to use on mariadb or whatever you want
See sqlheader.php and consql.php for current database and table usage/creation
