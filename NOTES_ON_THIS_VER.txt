Cleaned up the code a ton and updated

RECENT FIXES:
Removed use of prepare statements, otherwise dates would submit as 0000-00-00 
	despite being submitted the same format as the db
Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page
Workouts table shows averages and totals for cals burned by doing math on-page
Tables added for unit conversion (consql.php)
Updated weight in userinfo so that it will delete weight logs for duplicate dates 
Added some styling
Updated food table to include unit of serving size
Fixed table headers
Added favicon, cursor, some titles
Email field must be in email format at least
If registered user exists and all info the same, just log in
If change password matches old passwords, ask if they're sure
Added ability to reset password thru email (but that can't work on the school server) or for our situation, a form
Added security questions to use with password reset

OTHER NOTES:
Still need to put things in relevant views/public/etc. folders
Table measurement_conv requires viewing 2 pages to load all 72 rows, but this shouldn't be an issue since 
	use of site requires going through at least 2 pages
Add page titles, audios when updating styling
Still haven't rlly implemented unit conversion bc idk what we're supposed to use it for
Might change workouts implementation to be like food:
	a table of workout types with [cals burned per time] instead of [nutrition info per serving] 
	and a separate table for workout logging
Update workout to include intensity and duration

Now configured for my mariadb
See sqlheader.php and consql.php for current database and table usage/creation
