Cleaned up the code a ton and updated, but still not prim and pretty or anything.

Can't figure out why the form dates won't submit correctly. They keep going into the database as 0000-00-00 even though both the database and form seem to use the same yyyy-mm-dd format, which is shown when echoing $Featen_date or $Wdate. This problem didn't exist in the previous version either even tho the date is posted from the form the same way but whatever, hopefully we figure it out
Also haven't done anything abt unit conversion yet. Havent decided if will add table to db or just do math on-page

Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page

Still configured for phpmyadmin, so change the config file to use on mariadb or whatever you want
See sqlheader.php for current database and table usage/creation
