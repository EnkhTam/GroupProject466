Cleaned up the code a ton and updated, but still not prim and pretty or anything.

Removed use of prepare statements, otherwise dates would submit as 0000-00-00 despite being submitted the same format as the db
Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page
Workouts table shows averages and totals for cals burned by doing math on-page
Tables added for unit conversion (consql.php)
Updated weight in userinfo so that it will delete weight logs for duplicate dates 

Still haven't rlly implemented unit conversion
Might change workouts implementation to be like food; a table of workout types with [cals burned per time] instead of [nutrition info per serving] and a separate table for workout logging

Still configured for phpmyadmin, so change the config file to use on mariadb or whatever you want
See sqlheader.php and consql.php for current database and table usage/creation
