Cleaned up the code a ton and updated, but still not prim and pretty or anything.

Removed use of prepare statements, otherwise dates would submit as 0000-00-00 despite being submitted the same format as the db
Food log table shows nutrition info of servings consumed by doing math on-page
Workouts table shows averages and totals for cals burned by doing math on-page

Also haven't done anything abt unit conversion yet. Havent decided if will add table to db or just do math on-page
Might change workouts implementation to be like food; a table of workout types with [cals burned per time] instead of [nutrition info per serving] and a separate table for workout logging

Still configured for phpmyadmin, so change the config file to use on mariadb or whatever you want
See sqlheader.php for current database and table usage/creation
